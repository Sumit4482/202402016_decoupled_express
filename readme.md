## Switching Between MongoDB and Custom Database

To switch between MongoDB and a custom database in the Decoupled_Express API, follow these steps:

1. Set the `useMongo` boolean variable to `true` or `false` in the configuration file to choose between MongoDB and a custom database, respectively.
  
2. Configure the database connection settings accordingly in the `dbConfig.js` file based on the selected database type.
  
3. Run the application, and it will automatically use the specified database based on the value of the `useMongo` variable.

## Adding a New Endpoint

To add a new endpoint to the Decoupled_Express API, follow these steps:

1. Define the route and HTTP method in the appropriate route file (e.g., `productRoutes.js`, `cartRoutes.js`, etc.).
  
2. Create a corresponding controller function in the `controllers` directory to handle the logic for the new endpoint.
  
3. Implement any necessary services or helper functions in the `services` directory.
  
4. Test the new endpoint thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
  
5. Update the README.md file to document the new endpoint, including its route, purpose, and any required parameters or payloads.
